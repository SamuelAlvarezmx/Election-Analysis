## Election-Audit Summary 

For this election audit it was made a particular script in Python in order to perform the analysis for this work. However this script can be considered useful for future elections and in the next few lines it will be explained why.
1. The data gathered in the analysis was sotered in an csv file, which we coded in order to read the file in our script as shown in the image below. The file_to_load and file_to_save are variables that we can modify and the whole code wouldnÂ´t be affected because we are precisely using variables, we can change the value of the variable as much as we want to and our code is going to continue working as long as we are sure the values given fit the parameters.

2. It can be used not only for local elections but for many other elections. It needs only to be updated with the variables that we are performing this script, maybe rather than counties we are talking states or disctricts. The code will always perform the search of candidates and vote count for each candidate. Therefore we are talking a very powerful script that can be maleable to the needs of the client.
